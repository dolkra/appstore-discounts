      "description": "Meet Freya, the world’s first hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer, brought to you by The Positive Birth Company. This award-winning birth timer supports you through labour, coaching you through every single surge (or contraction) with a simple breathing technique and guided relaxations. \n\n\nPut hypnobirthing techniques into practice during pregnancy, labour and childbirth \nRelax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations\nBirth timer that keeps track of surges, logging each surge or contraction so you can see how frequently they are coming and how long they are lasting\nReceive a notification from Freya when your labour is established and it might be a good time to call your midwife\nUse Freya during pregnancy to practice breathing techniques and relaxation \nAvailable in French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian\n\n\nNever birth alone with Freya by your side.\n\n\nTRACK YOUR SURGES\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, because a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, using appropriate terminology, but can be used by anyone. If you would like to know more about Hypnobirthing, follow The Positive Birth Company on Instagram or Tik Tok where we share loads of free resources to make your birth better.\n\n\nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\nYou can use this birth timer in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for childbirth. In fact the more you practice your breathing and listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. You can practice daily and then reset the surge history whenever you like.\n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable.\n\n\nLIFESKILLS\nFreya can be used for pregnancy and post-birth relaxation, any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn - mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques - are skills for life.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place please do let us know at hello@thepositivebirthcompany.com\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n- iPhone and Apple Watch app\n- Timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer) and let you know when you’re in established labour\n- Coaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge and the ability to switch between 4 and 8 breath counts or 3 and 6, or turn the counting off altogether.\n- 4 different birth coach voices\n- Guided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you relaxed between surges\n- A gentle expanding visualisation that you can use to sync your breathing\n- Option to record your own music, visualisations or relaxation tracks\n- You can listen to your own playlist on a third party app (such as Spotify) whilst still using the Freya app to keep track of your surges and coach you through each one.\n- A detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour, reset this after you practice breathwork at any time\n- Ability to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\n- Coaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

      "description": "Meet Freya, the world’s first hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer, brought to you by The Positive Birth Company. This award-winning birth timer supports you through labour, coaching you through every single surge (or contraction) with a simple breathing technique and guided relaxations. \n\n\nPut hypnobirthing techniques into practice during pregnancy, labour and childbirth \nRelax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations\nBirth timer that keeps track of surges, logging each surge or contraction so you can see how frequently they are coming and how long they are lasting\nReceive a notification from Freya when your labour is established and it might be a good time to call your midwife\nUse Freya during pregnancy to practice breathing techniques and relaxation \nAvailable in French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian\n\n\nNever birth alone with Freya by your side.\n\n\nTRACK YOUR SURGES\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, because a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, using appropriate terminology, but can be used by anyone. If you would like to know more about Hypnobirthing, follow The Positive Birth Company on Instagram or Tik Tok where we share loads of free resources to make your birth better.\n\n\nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\nYou can use this birth timer in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for childbirth. In fact the more you practice your breathing and listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. You can practice daily and then reset the surge history whenever you like.\n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable.\n\n\nLIFESKILLS\nFreya can be used for pregnancy and post-birth relaxation, any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn - mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques - are skills for life.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place please do let us know at hello@thepositivebirthcompany.com\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n- iPhone and Apple Watch app\n- Timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer) and let you know when you’re in established labour\n- Coaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge and the ability to switch between 4 and 8 breath counts or 3 and 6, or turn the counting off altogether.\n- 4 different birth coach voices\n- Guided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you relaxed between surges\n- A gentle expanding visualisation that you can use to sync your breathing\n- Option to record your own music, visualisations or relaxation tracks\n- You can listen to your own playlist on a third party app (such as Spotify) whilst still using the Freya app to keep track of your surges and coach you through each one.\n- A detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour, reset this after you practice breathwork at any time\n- Ability to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\n- Coaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

      "description": "Meet Freya, the world’s first hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer, brought to you by The Positive Birth Company. This award-winning birth timer supports you through labour, coaching you through every single surge (or contraction) with a simple breathing technique and guided relaxations. \n\n\nPut hypnobirthing techniques into practice during pregnancy, labour and childbirth \nRelax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations\nBirth timer that keeps track of surges, logging each surge or contraction so you can see how frequently they are coming and how long they are lasting\nReceive a notification from Freya when your labour is established and it might be a good time to call your midwife\nUse Freya during pregnancy to practice breathing techniques and relaxation \nAvailable in French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian\n\n\nNever birth alone with Freya by your side.\n\n\nTRACK YOUR SURGES\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, because a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, using appropriate terminology, but can be used by anyone. If you would like to know more about Hypnobirthing, follow The Positive Birth Company on Instagram or Tik Tok where we share loads of free resources to make your birth better.\n\n\nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\nYou can use this birth timer in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for childbirth. In fact the more you practice your breathing and listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. You can practice daily and then reset the surge history whenever you like.\n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable.\n\n\nLIFESKILLS\nFreya can be used for pregnancy and post-birth relaxation, any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn - mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques - are skills for life.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place please do let us know at hello@thepositivebirthcompany.com\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n- iPhone and Apple Watch app\n- Timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer) and let you know when you’re in established labour\n- Coaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge and the ability to switch between 4 and 8 breath counts or 3 and 6, or turn the counting off altogether.\n- 4 different birth coach voices\n- Guided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you relaxed between surges\n- A gentle expanding visualisation that you can use to sync your breathing\n- Option to record your own music, visualisations or relaxation tracks\n- You can listen to your own playlist on a third party app (such as Spotify) whilst still using the Freya app to keep track of your surges and coach you through each one.\n- A detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour, reset this after you practice breathwork at any time\n- Ability to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\n- Coaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

      "description": "這是我們開發的一款單機向SLG\n借鑒和學習了《三國志》、《霸王的大陸》系列，\n內容豐富耐玩，上手後極易沉迷，\n遊戲沒有大額付費，就算不付費也可以愉快的玩幾十個小時。\n但由於難度較高，強烈不建議新手上來就挑戰困難難度。\n\n【遊戲特點】\n豐富的戰鬥陣形和技能，\n在戰斗場景中山河、湖泊、城關等不同地形上有變化多端的戰術組合，\n加上天氣系統對戰局的影響，使得戰場玩法極具特色。\n\n根據面對敵人的情況不同，\n不同戰術可以形成各自的打法流派，\n常見的如搶城速攻流、近戰突擊流，單挑控制流、遠射連珠流等等。\n\n數十萬字原創遊戲文本，全部源自製作團隊對相關史料的分析提煉，\n各種武將列傳、軼事；各地的背景介紹，皆有可靠的依據出處。\n玩家玩遊戲的同時能感受到那個時代的文化氣息、社會風貌，\n從更豐富的層面帶玩家領略濃厚的歷史人文精神。\n\n【玩家攻略社区】 \nFacebook:三國志天下布武 \n\nLine:sanguo15\n\n\n\n【為什麼選擇開發這款遊戲】\n我從小便沉迷於《霸王的大陸》和光榮的《三國志》，\n但市面上很難找到類似玩法的手機遊戲。\n於是我做了一個，只是沒想到，這個歷程是如此的艱難。\n\n我常常跟同是做這類產品的朋友浪子交流，他說《漢末霸業》一路走來，一樣殊為不易，在這個年代想要有自己的堅持，必須付出相當的代價。\n\n經常有朋友問我，“為什麼不去做別的更賺錢的遊戲？”\n的確，我們的這款遊戲不怎麼賺錢，\n不充值都可以玩的很開心，充個幾十能嗨皮幾個月。\n\n朋友的這個問題，是對我的靈魂拷問。\n因為我的年紀已經不小了，拖家帶口的，這個問題必須正視。\n但朋友說的“那種賺錢的遊戲”，我不喜歡。\n\n朋友不理解我對這種遊戲的感情。\n在那個網吧還只有局域網的年代，\n這個品類的遊戲伴著我度過了無數個日日夜夜。\n為了統一全國殫精竭慮，以至於茶飯不思、夙夜難眠。\n那時的我，是沉浸的，是幸福的。\n而現在，我有機會能利用我的專業技能把這種感受發揚光大。\n把我自己對這種遊戲的理解傾注到產品之中，\n置於更大的平台之上，\n讓更多跟我同樣喜歡這類游戲的玩家體會到這種快樂，\n這是一種使命，一種榮譽。\n\n能做這個遊戲，是我人生中最幸福的事情。\n我還有很多關於它的想法，已經在心頭縈繞多年，\n我想要呈現的，還遠不止之前大家曾看到的。\n如果能賺錢，我會把這個遊戲一直做下去。\n如果賺不到，我就先去做點別的，用賺來的錢把這個遊戲繼續做下去。\n\n逝水東流，青山依舊，是非成敗，任人評說。\n我素未謀面的朋友們，祝你們玩得開心。\n\n\n\n——遊戲製作人：奶牛",

      "description": "Meet Freya, the world’s first hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer, brought to you by The Positive Birth Company. This award-winning birth timer supports you through labour, coaching you through every single surge (or contraction) with a simple breathing technique and guided relaxations. \n\n\nPut hypnobirthing techniques into practice during pregnancy, labour and childbirth \nRelax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations\nBirth timer that keeps track of surges, logging each surge or contraction so you can see how frequently they are coming and how long they are lasting\nReceive a notification from Freya when your labour is established and it might be a good time to call your midwife\nUse Freya during pregnancy to practice breathing techniques and relaxation \nAvailable in French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian\n\n\nNever birth alone with Freya by your side.\n\n\nTRACK YOUR SURGES\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, because a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, using appropriate terminology, but can be used by anyone. If you would like to know more about Hypnobirthing, follow The Positive Birth Company on Instagram or Tik Tok where we share loads of free resources to make your birth better.\n\n\nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\nYou can use this birth timer in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for childbirth. In fact the more you practice your breathing and listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. You can practice daily and then reset the surge history whenever you like.\n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable.\n\n\nLIFESKILLS\nFreya can be used for pregnancy and post-birth relaxation, any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn - mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques - are skills for life.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place please do let us know at hello@thepositivebirthcompany.com\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n- iPhone and Apple Watch app\n- Timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer) and let you know when you’re in established labour\n- Coaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge and the ability to switch between 4 and 8 breath counts or 3 and 6, or turn the counting off altogether.\n- 4 different birth coach voices\n- Guided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you relaxed between surges\n- A gentle expanding visualisation that you can use to sync your breathing\n- Option to record your own music, visualisations or relaxation tracks\n- You can listen to your own playlist on a third party app (such as Spotify) whilst still using the Freya app to keep track of your surges and coach you through each one.\n- A detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour, reset this after you practice breathwork at any time\n- Ability to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\n- Coaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

A player can use a sword to attack monsters, or a bow and an arrow to destroy enemies from afar. Pushing the obstacles back with a shield and pulling the monsters with a pair of special gloves.\n\nThere are 150 handcrafted rooms in the dungeon.

      "description": "IMPORTANT \nDOES NOT support: iPhone 5S, iPad Air, iPad Mini 2 & 3 and iPod Touch\n\nInterpret the law as you see fit in This Is the Police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama This Is the Police! Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, and incarcerate. Make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure, strategy, and turn-based tactical combat.\n\nIs it a simulation? A management game? A tactical challenge? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!\n\nDive into one-of-a-kind -story-driven experience.\nWelcome to Sharpwood, a cold and harsh border town riven with violence, where no one is completely innocent. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. To maintain peace and order, the young sheriff Lilly Reed (Sarah Hamilton) will have to team up with fugitive criminal Jack Boyd (Jon St. John), and pray that her dangerous plan doesn’t spiral out of control.\n\nTake charge of the Sheriff’s department.\nYour subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears, and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all of them in order to survive. Is one of your guys drinking too much? Or always coming up with excuses for not coming to work? Or does he refuse to follow orders? You’ll have to show a steady hand if you want to impose discipline on this department.\n\nEngage in tactical combat.\nDuring your most dangerous operations, the game will switch to turn-based combat. Gather a team of your finest cops. Carefully study the terrain, adapt your plans, stealthily approach your suspects and use non-lethal weapons and equipment – if the situation allows. True, sometimes gunfights are almost impossible to avoid, but be careful: This Is the Police 2 doesn’t have hit points. A single bullet can cost a cop their life.\n\nBecome a true detective.\nCollect evidence, study case materials, interrogate suspects and send the criminals to court. And if the suspect was innocent? Perhaps it's time to find out if any Sharpwood judges can be bought.\n\nThank you for playing ‘THIS IS THE POLICE 2’!\n\nGet in touch with HandyGamesTM: www.handy-games.com\nJoin us on Facebook: HandyGames\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: HandyGames\nCheck news on Twitter: @handy_games\nFollow us on Instagram: handygames\n\nImprint: http://www.handy-games.com/contact/\n\n© www.handy-games.com GmbH",

      "description": "Meet Freya, the world’s first hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer, brought to you by The Positive Birth Company. This award-winning birth timer supports you through labour, coaching you through every single surge (or contraction) with a simple breathing technique and guided relaxations. \n\n\nPut hypnobirthing techniques into practice during pregnancy, labour and childbirth \nRelax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations\nBirth timer that keeps track of surges, logging each surge or contraction so you can see how frequently they are coming and how long they are lasting\nReceive a notification from Freya when your labour is established and it might be a good time to call your midwife\nUse Freya during pregnancy to practice breathing techniques and relaxation \nAvailable in French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian\n\n\nNever birth alone with Freya by your side.\n\n\nTRACK YOUR SURGES\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, because a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, using appropriate terminology, but can be used by anyone. If you would like to know more about Hypnobirthing, follow The Positive Birth Company on Instagram or Tik Tok where we share loads of free resources to make your birth better.\n\n\nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\nYou can use this birth timer in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for childbirth. In fact the more you practice your breathing and listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. You can practice daily and then reset the surge history whenever you like.\n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable.\n\n\nLIFESKILLS\nFreya can be used for pregnancy and post-birth relaxation, any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn - mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques - are skills for life.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place please do let us know at hello@thepositivebirthcompany.com\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n- iPhone and Apple Watch app\n- Timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer) and let you know when you’re in established labour\n- Coaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge and the ability to switch between 4 and 8 breath counts or 3 and 6, or turn the counting off altogether.\n- 4 different birth coach voices\n- Guided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you relaxed between surges\n- A gentle expanding visualisation that you can use to sync your breathing\n- Option to record your own music, visualisations or relaxation tracks\n- You can listen to your own playlist on a third party app (such as Spotify) whilst still using the Freya app to keep track of your surges and coach you through each one.\n- A detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour, reset this after you practice breathwork at any time\n- Ability to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\n- Coaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

A player can use a sword to attack monsters, or a bow and an arrow to destroy enemies from afar. Pushing the obstacles back with a shield and pulling the monsters with a pair of special gloves.\n\nThere are 150 handcrafted rooms in the dungeon. Players will have to get a better understanding of the game to solve the puzzles and clear the rooms.\n\nTo beat the puzzles with fewer moves, achieving advanced goals, players will have to try different tactics and move combinations to find an optimized solution for the room. Sometimes a player would need to put the old solution aside and take on a new perspective towards the problem, reexamine and rethink before making a move.\n\nFeatures:\n● Dungeon + Puzzle + Sokoban\n● 150 handcrafted rooms\n● Fantasy themed pixel art\n● Non-linear dungeon map\n\n--\n\n● Follow us on Twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/nekolyst\n● Like us on Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Nekolyst\n● Join our Discord server\nhttps://discord.gg/A7Sss9d",

      "description": "IMPORTANT \nDOES NOT support: iPhone 5S, iPad Air, iPad Mini 2 & 3 and iPod Touch\n\nInterpret the law as you see fit in This Is the Police 2, sequel to the acclaimed noir drama This Is the Police! Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, and incarcerate. Make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure, strategy, and turn-based tactical combat.\n\nIs it a simulation? A management game? A tactical challenge? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more!\n\nDive into one-of-a-kind -story-driven experience.\nWelcome to Sharpwood, a cold and harsh border town riven with violence, where no one is completely innocent. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. To maintain peace and order, the young sheriff Lilly Reed (Sarah Hamilton) will have to team up with fugitive criminal Jack Boyd (Jon St. John), and pray that her dangerous plan doesn’t spiral out of control.\n\nTake charge of the Sheriff’s department.\nYour subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears, and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all of them in order to survive. Is one of your guys drinking too much? Or always coming up with excuses for not coming to work? Or does he refuse to follow orders? You’ll have to show a steady hand if you want to impose discipline on this department.\n\nEngage in tactical combat.\nDuring your most dangerous operations, the game will switch to turn-based combat. Gather a team of your finest cops. Carefully study the terrain, adapt your plans, stealthily approach your suspects and use non-lethal weapons and equipment – if the situation allows. True, sometimes gunfights are almost impossible to avoid, but be careful: This Is the Police 2 doesn’t have hit points. A single bullet can cost a cop their life.\n\nBecome a true detective.\nCollect evidence, study case materials, interrogate suspects and send the criminals to court. And if the suspect was innocent? Perhaps it's time to find out if any Sharpwood judges can be bought.\n\nThank you for playing ‘THIS IS THE POLICE 2’!\n\nGet in touch with HandyGamesTM: www.handy-games.com\nJoin us on Facebook: HandyGames\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: HandyGames\nCheck news on Twitter: @handy_games\nFollow us on Instagram: handygames\n\nImprint: http://www.handy-games.com/contact/\n\n© www.handy-games.com GmbH",

      "description": "Meet Freya, the world’s first hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer, brought to you by The Positive Birth Company. This award-winning birth timer supports you through labour, coaching you through every single surge (or contraction) with a simple breathing technique and guided relaxations. \n\n\nPut hypnobirthing techniques into practice during pregnancy, labour and childbirth \nRelax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations\nBirth timer that keeps track of surges, logging each surge or contraction so you can see how frequently they are coming and how long they are lasting\nReceive a notification from Freya when your labour is established and it might be a good time to call your midwife\nUse Freya during pregnancy to practice breathing techniques and relaxation \nAvailable in French, German, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian\n\n\nNever birth alone with Freya by your side.\n\n\nTRACK YOUR SURGES\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, because a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, using appropriate terminology, but can be used by anyone. If you would like to know more about Hypnobirthing, follow The Positive Birth Company on Instagram or Tik Tok where we share loads of free resources to make your birth better.\n\n\nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\nYou can use this birth timer in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for childbirth. In fact the more you practice your breathing and listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. You can practice daily and then reset the surge history whenever you like.\n\n\nTHE SCIENCE\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable.\n\n\nLIFESKILLS\nFreya can be used for pregnancy and post-birth relaxation, any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn - mindfulness exercises and breathing techniques - are skills for life.\n\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place please do let us know at hello@thepositivebirthcompany.com\n\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n- iPhone and Apple Watch app\n- Timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer) and let you know when you’re in established labour\n- Coaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge and the ability to switch between 4 and 8 breath counts or 3 and 6, or turn the counting off altogether.\n- 4 different birth coach voices\n- Guided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you relaxed between surges\n- A gentle expanding visualisation that you can use to sync your breathing\n- Option to record your own music, visualisations or relaxation tracks\n- You can listen to your own playlist on a third party app (such as Spotify) whilst still using the Freya app to keep track of your surges and coach you through each one.\n- A detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour, reset this after you practice breathwork at any time\n- Ability to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\n- Coaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly birth timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

      "description": "這是我們開發的一款單機向SLG\n借鑒和學習了《三國志》、《霸王的大陸》系列，\n內容豐富耐玩，上手後極易沉迷，\n遊戲沒有大額付費，就算不付費也可以愉快的玩幾十個小時。\n但由於難度較高，強烈不建議新手上來就挑戰困難難度。\n\n【遊戲特點】\n豐富的戰鬥陣形和技能，\n在戰斗場景中山河、湖泊、城關等不同地形上有變化多端的戰術組合，\n加上天氣系統對戰局的影響，使得戰場玩法極具特色。\n\n根據面對敵人的情況不同，\n不同戰術可以形成各自的打法流派，\n常見的如搶城速攻流、近戰突擊流，單挑控制流、遠射連珠流等等。\n\n數十萬字原創遊戲文本，全部源自製作團隊對相關史料的分析提煉，\n各種武將列傳、軼事；各地的背景介紹，皆有可靠的依據出處。\n玩家玩遊戲的同時能感受到那個時代的文化氣息、社會風貌，\n從更豐富的層面帶玩家領略濃厚的歷史人文精神。\n\n【玩家攻略社区】 \nFacebook:三國志天下布武 \n\nLine:sanguo15\n\n\n\n【為什麼選擇開發這款遊戲】\n我從小便沉迷於《霸王的大陸》和光榮的《三國志》，\n但市面上很難找到類似玩法的手機遊戲。\n於是我做了一個，只是沒想到，這個歷程是如此的艱難。\n\n我常常跟同是做這類產品的朋友浪子交流，他說《漢末霸業》一路走來，一樣殊為不易，在這個年代想要有自己的堅持，必須付出相當的代價。\n\n經常有朋友問我，“為什麼不去做別的更賺錢的遊戲？”\n的確，我們的這款遊戲不怎麼賺錢，\n不充值都可以玩的很開心，充個幾十能嗨皮幾個月。\n\n朋友的這個問題，是對我的靈魂拷問。\n因為我的年紀已經不小了，拖家帶口的，這個問題必須正視。\n但朋友說的“那種賺錢的遊戲”，我不喜歡。\n\n朋友不理解我對這種遊戲的感情。\n在那個網吧還只有局域網的年代，\n這個品類的遊戲伴著我度過了無數個日日夜夜。\n為了統一全國殫精竭慮，以至於茶飯不思、夙夜難眠。\n那時的我，是沉浸的，是幸福的。\n而現在，我有機會能利用我的專業技能把這種感受發揚光大。\n把我自己對這種遊戲的理解傾注到產品之中，\n置於更大的平台之上，\n讓更多跟我同樣喜歡這類游戲的玩家體會到這種快樂，\n這是一種使命，一種榮譽。\n\n能做這個遊戲，是我人生中最幸福的事情。\n我還有很多關於它的想法，已經在心頭縈繞多年，\n我想要呈現的，還遠不止之前大家曾看到的。\n如果能賺錢，我會把這個遊戲一直做下去。\n如果賺不到，我就先去做點別的，用賺來的錢把這個遊戲繼續做下去。\n\n逝水東流，青山依舊，是非成敗，任人評說。\n我素未謀面的朋友們，祝你們玩得開心。\n\n\n\n——遊戲製作人：奶牛",
